The project is aimed at providing a safe platform for people to track the status of their
filed FIR and report cybercrimes committed against them. Anyone can check the status of 
their FIR through a unique number (ID) which is provided with every report. One can 
even raise their reports to higher authorities if one is not satisfied with the actions being 
taken by the police
